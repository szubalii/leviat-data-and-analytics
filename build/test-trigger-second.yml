# test-trigger-second YAML pipeline
# We are setting up a pipeline resource that references the test-trigger-first
# pipeline and setting up a pipeline completion trigger so that our test-trigger-second
# pipeline runs when a run of the test-trigger-first pipeline completes
resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: securitylib # Name of the pipeline resource.
    source: test-trigger-first # The name of the pipeline referenced by this pipeline resource.
    trigger: true # Run test-trigger-second pipeline when any run of test-trigger-first completes

steps:
- bash: echo "test-trigger-second runs after test-trigger-first completes"
