        For all non Successful file names, check which activities were successful before the first non Successful activity
        All subsequent activities for those file names need to re-run.

        TODO what about entities that are not scheduled but do have historic failed activities?

        What about duplicate batch activities for successful Extract, with the earlier succesful and the more recent failed?
